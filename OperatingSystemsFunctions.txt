Memory management - The operating system uses memory management in order to keep track of all the different programs requesting memory from your system. It tracks when memory is free, when it is allocated, and which memory locations are assigned. The memory management function is responsible for viewing the different competing processes running on your computer and deciding which programs receive memory, how much memory each program receives, and when they receive it. If this function were not available, multiple programs would try to grab locations of memory at the same time causing the system to not function properly.

Disk management - Disk management is used by the operating system to control all the various drives connected to your PC. It is responsible for many functions including formatting and partitioning drives, assigning letters to drives, and changing file systems. Both MAC and Windows both have a disk management tool with a GUI that enables the user to make changes to drives, and view drive information such as total capacity, free space, file system, and drive type.
  
Automatic updates - This is an especially important function of the operating system as it keeps your computers OS up to date. Without this function, users would have to search online for all of the different updates that are released for their operating system. Instead, your operating system will see that you are online, check the version of your software against the newest released version, and automatically download and install the update if necessary. This feature can also be disabled or modified as well if you do not want to update your system for any reason, or if you want to pick and choose which updates you receive.

Memory management - The operating system uses memory management in order to keep track of all the different programs requesting memory from your system. It tracks when memory is free,
                    when it is allocated, and which locations are assigned. The memory management function is responsible for viewing the different competing processes running on your computer and deciding
                    deciding which programs receive memory, how much memory each program receives, and when they recieve it. If this function was not available, multiple programs would try to grab
                    locations of memory at the same time causing the system to not function properly.
